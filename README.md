Who’s Online? – Online social medium for gamers to find other players to play Online games with.

As a user, I want to be able to…
- Sign Up
- Log In
- Log Out
- Create a Looking for Game post
- Edit my Looking for Game post
- Browse other user’s Looking for Game post
- Sort Looking for Game posts by Game
- Remove my Looking for Game post
- Add reviews to other users profiles
- Be able to see a “positivity” number indicator (1-10) that represents how friendly a user is based on user input.

Schedule to complete this project:
- I want to plan to accomplish the majority of the functionality for this project within the first half of the week, so that I will have plenty of time to make the app look great visually, and to refine and stomp out any bugs that come up.
- Things I can finish on Day 1: Sign Up, Log In, Log Out
- Things I can finish on Day 2: Create a LFG Post, Edit my LFG Post, Browse LFG Posts, Remove my LFG Posts
- Things I can attempt to finish on Day 3: Sort LFG Posts by Game, Getting User Profiles set up, adding reviews to user profiles and having the positivity number displayed on those profiles.
Anything not finished on Day 1, 2, 3, finish them on Day 4.
- Stomp any bugs out on Day 5, really putting emphasis on making sure my code is DRY, spend the rest of the day styling and creating a good appearance.
